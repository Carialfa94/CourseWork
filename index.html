<p>My name is Carina Alfaro and I am a Latina first-generation college student, currently completing the track of Database Analytics. 
  I am 24 years old and I am born in California. Reading, going for walks and spending time with my family are of my most favorite hobbies. </p>
<p>I am enrolled in Bellevue College, completing the Year up Program from which I will obtain the knowledge and skills that are requires to be successful in my career path. 
  I have been able to learn SQL; to store, query and manipulate data discovering it naturally comes to me and I enjoy it. Along with this Excel where it has showed me a new type of organization, precision and simplification of data while using spreadsheets. While in Programming I had the opportunity to learn and utilize HTML, JAVASCRIPT AND CSS while creating new websites I can say the thing I enjoy most about it is debugging.</p>
<p>I have discovered that I enjoy programming, personal relations, working with database and making an impact this brought me to research the academic path of Business Intelligence 
  where I see myself completing as a future academic goal. My career goal would be to work in an institution where I can contribute to the community while making a change in peopleâ€™s life. 
  There are many projects taking place that require determination, leadership and perseverance to make an impact and I feel I have what it takes.
